      <title>Clark&#39;s Nutcracker Forest Habitat Use and Seed Resource Selection in Yellowstone National Park</title>
      <link>/project/internal-project-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nutcrackers are resource driven foragers.
Within Yellowstone National Park we are trying to determine which confier species are important to nutcrackers and how they use them during cone ripening season.
Ally is a Graduate Research Assistant on this project tasked with collecting an analyzing the data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Freshwater Mites as an Indicator of Water Quality</title>
      <link>/project/internal-project-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freshwater mites are present in lakes and streams. They, like many other macroinvertebrates, can be an indicator of water quality. This project will investigate what water attirbutes can be associated with mites and why. Ally is the lead for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stable Isotope Analysis and Painted Bunting Origin-Implications for International Pet Trade</title>
      <link>/project/internal-project-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/internal-project-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where do birds that end up in international pet trade come from? How do we know whether or not they have been legally obtained? What happens when a cute colorful songbird crosses a mosaic of different laws and regulations along its migratory route? Tune in to this project for answers to these questions and more!

      <title>Quantifying Urban Prey Availability For City Raptors</title>
      <link>/project/internal-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/internal-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Investigation into available prey items in urban environments. Camera traps were laid out to get a feel for the food sources available in heavily urban environments. The next step will be a more intense search/assessment followed by connecting those abundances back to urban raptor ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
